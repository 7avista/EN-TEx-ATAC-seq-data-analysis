## ChIP‚Äêseq processing, EN-TEx ATAC-seq data analysis, and Distal regulatory activity
Data analysis for Epignomics UVic

This repository starts from the epinomics-Uvic repository clone (https://github.com/bborsari/epigenomics_uvic) to get the ChIP-seq processing workflow results, ATAC-seq workflow results, and Distal regulatory activity workflow results. 

The analyses have been run by using:

  docker run -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD --rm -it dgarrimar/epigenomics_course

All the steps to obtain the published results can be followed in the Wiki section, with script commented tips.
